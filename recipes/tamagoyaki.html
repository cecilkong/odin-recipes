    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tamagoyaki is a type of Japanese omelette made by rolling together several layers of fried egg.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil</li>
        <li>1 ½ sheet nori (seaweed)/li>
        <li>3 Tbsp dashi </li>
        <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp mirin</li>
        <li>2 pinch kosher salt</li>
        <li>3 oz daikon radish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gently whisk the eggs in a bowl. It's best to "cut" the eggs with chopsticks in a zig-zag motion and do not over mix.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, combine the seasonings and mix well.</li>
        <li>Pour the seasonings mixture into the egg mixture and whisk gently. Then pour the mixture into a measuring cup with spout and handle (so that it'll be easier to pour into the frying pan).</li>
        <li>Heat the pan over medium heat, dip a folded paper towel in oil and apply to the pan. Put a little bit of egg mixture to see if the pan is hot.</li>
        <li>When you hear the sizzling sound, pour a thin layer of egg mixture in the pan, tilting to cover the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Poke the air bubbles to release the air. After the bottom of the egg has set but still soft on top, start rolling into a log shape from one side to the other.</li>
        <li>Move the rolled omelette to the side where you started to roll, and apply oil to the pan with a paper towel, even under the omelette.</li>
        <li>Pour the egg mixture to cover the bottom of the pan again. Make sure to lift the omelette to spread the mixture underneath.</li>
        <li>When the new layer of egg has set and still soft on top, start rolling from one side to the other.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 8 and 9 until all of the whisked eggs are used up.</li>
        <li>Remove from the pan and place the omelette on the bamboo sushi mat and wrap it up. Shape the egg when it is still hot. Let it stand for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>To serve, slice the omelette into ½" (1 cm) pieces and grate some daikon over the omelette.</li>
    </ol>
